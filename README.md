# DrivingHelper

I want to create an original IOS application that intends to help student drivers during their learning process for their Permits / License. 

The app will let the user choose between Beginner Level vs Intermediate level. The user can read the rules of driving, and be directed to a more in depth
website for all the rules as well depending on their states. The student / user can read about tips for driving and for obtaining 1. Permit and 2. License. 

Each Beginner Level and Intermediate Level will have an interactive (with a hands free disclaimer, and if under a certain age, instruct them to have a
passenger with a license in the car with them) step by step instructions / tips during their drive. This is to practice for their Permit test if they are
in the Beginner Level, and for their license test if they are in the Intermediate level. 

In the future, I want the user to be able to sign up with a profile and choose a level to start with. If they already have a permit they can choose the
Intermediate level.

If the user obtains a permit, they will be able to update their profile and move on to the intermediate level. 

If the user obtainhs both a permit and a license, they will be taken to a neat "certification" page, congratulating them.
